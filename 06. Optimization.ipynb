We can define the approximate Hessian for each iteration, $\\mathbf{H}_k$. To start as simple as possible, we will assume the Hessian can be approximated with one vector. Let's start off with a few other assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "One property of the hessian is called the Secant equation, which relates the change in input to the change in the derivative. The Secant Equation (exact for quadratic functions) is:\n",

If we enforce this relationship, we can find the hessian, assuming that the current location is approximated well by a quadratic (making the Secant a good assumption also).

Since the Hessian is the second partial derivative, a starting approximation might be the gradient difference we already defined such that  $\\mathbf{H} \\approx \\mathbf{v}\\cdot\\mathbf{v}^T$ which would form a matrix of the differences of each partial deriviative in the gradient.
