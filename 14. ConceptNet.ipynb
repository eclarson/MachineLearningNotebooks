    "## Let's make a sentiment classifier!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a very frequently-implemented task in NLP, and it's no surprise. Recognizing whether people are expressing positive or negative opinions about things has obvious business applications. It's used in social media monitoring, customer feedback, and even automatic stock trading (leading to bots that [buy Berkshire Hathaway when Anne Hathaway gets a good movie review](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/03/does-anne-hathaway-news-drive-berkshire-hathaways-stock/72661/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's simplistic, sometimes too simplistic, but it's one of the easiest ways to get measurable results from NLP. In a few steps, you can put text in one end and get positive and negative scores out the other, and you never have to figure out what you should do with a parse tree or a graph of entities or any difficult representation like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that's what we're going to do here, following the path of least resistance at every step, obtaining a classifier that should look very familiar to anyone involved in current NLP. For example, you can find this model described in the [Deep Averaging Networks](http://cs.umd.edu/~miyyer/pubs/2015_acl_dan.pdf) paper (Iyyer et al., 2015). This model is not the point of that paper, so don't take this as an attack on their results; it was there as an example of a well-known way to use word vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the outline of what we're going to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Acquire some typical **word embeddings** to represent the meanings of words\n",
    "* Acquire **training and test data**, with gold-standard examples of positive and negative words\n",
    "* **Train a classifier**, using gradient descent, to recognize other positive and negative words based on their word embeddings\n",
    "* Compute **sentiment scores** for sentences of text using this classifier\n",
    "* **Behold the monstrosity** that we have created\n",
    "\n",
    "And at that point we will have shown \"how to make a racist AI without really trying\". Of course that would be a terrible place to leave it, so afterward, we're going to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Measure the problem** statistically, so we can recognize if we're solving it\n",
    "* **Improve the data** to obtain a semantic model that's more accurate _and_ less racist"

    "\n",
    "You could also replace `scikit-learn` with TensorFlow or Keras or something like that, as they can also train classifiers using gradient descent. But there's no need for the deep-learning abstractions they provide, as it only takes a single layer of machine learning to solve this problem."

    "## Step 1: Word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are frequently used to represent words as inputs to machine learning. The words become vectors in a multi-dimensional space, where nearby vectors represent similar meanings. With word embeddings, you can compare words by (roughly) what they mean, not just exact string matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Successfully training word vectors requires starting from hundreds of gigabytes of input text. Fortunately, various machine-learning groups have already done this and provided pre-trained word embeddings that we can download.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two very well-known datasets of pre-trained English word embeddings are **word2vec**, pretrained on Google News data, and **GloVe**, pretrained on the Common Crawl of web pages. We would get similar results for either one, but here we'll use GloVe because its source of data is more transparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "GloVe comes in three sizes: 6B, 42B, and 840B. The 840B size is powerful, but requires significant post-processing to use it in a way that's an improvement over 42B. The 42B version is pretty good and is also neatly trimmed to a vocabulary of 1 million words. Because we're following the path of least resistance, we'll just use the 42B version.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Why does it matter that the word embeddings are \"well-known\"?**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I'm glad you asked, hypothetical questioner! We're trying to do something extremely typical at each step, and for some reason, comparison-shopping for better word embeddings isn't typical yet. Read on, and I hope you'll come out of this tutorial with the desire to use [modern, high-quality word embeddings](https://github.com/commonsense/conceptnet-numberbatch), especially those that are aware of algorithmic bias and try to mitigate it. But that's getting ahead of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "We download glove.6B.300d.zip from [the GloVe web page](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/), and extract it into `large_data/glove/glove.42B.300d.txt`. Next we define a function to read the simple format of its word vectors.\n"

    "ConceptNet, the knowledge graph I work on with word-embedding features built in, has a training step that adjusts the embeddings to identify and remove some sources of algorithmic racism and sexism. This step is based on Bolukbasi et al.'s \"[Debiasing Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06520)\", and generalized to address multiple forms of prejudice at once. As far as I know, we're the only semantic system that has anything of the sort built in.\n",

The April 2017 release was the first to include this de-biasing step, so let's load its English vectors and retrain our sentiment model with them.\n",

    "The ranges of sentiments overlap a lot more than they did in the word vectors that came directly from GloVe or word2vec. The F-value is less than a third of what it was for GloVe, and a quarter of what it was for word2vec. And in general, we see much smaller differences in sentiment that come from comparing different given names, which is what we'd hope for, because names really shouldn't matter to the task of sentiment analysis.\n",

That would have been a bad move, because the problem _isn't_ completely solved.  There are more causes of algorithmic racism than the ones we have identified and compensated for in ConceptNet. But this is a good start."

    "\n",
    "This is of course only one way to do sentiment analysis. All the steps we used are common, but you probably object that you wouldn't do it that way. But if you have your own process, I urge you to see if your process is encoding prejudices and biases in the model it learns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of or in addition to changing your source of word vectors, you could try to fix this problem in the output directly. It may help, for example, to build a stronger model of whether sentiment should be assigned to words at all, designed to specifically exclude names and groups of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could abandon the idea of inferring sentiment for words, and only count the sentiment of words that appear exactly in the list. This is perhaps the most common form of sentiment analysis -- the kind that includes no machine learning at all. Its results will be no more biased than whoever made the list. But the lack of machine learning means that this approach has low recall, and the only way to adapt it to your data set is to edit the list manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a hybrid approach, you could produce a large number of inferred sentiments for words, and have a human annotator patiently look through them, making a list of exceptions whose sentiment should be set to 0. The downside of this is that it's extra work; the upside is that you take the time to actually see what your data is doing. And that's something that I think should happen more often in machine learning anyway.\n"
